metl: A generic framework for sequential and parallel metaheuristics
Copyright (c) 2005-2015, Sylvain Ouellet

I wrote this framework for the development of sequential and parallel
metaheuristics as part of my master thesis in 2005. Unfortunetly, I
left it gather dust and bit rot on my hard disk for too long. 

The code dates a bit, but I still think it is very good. I decided to
distribute it in the hope it will be useful for someone. 

If you find it to be useful for you, I'd appreciate if you drop me a
line.
