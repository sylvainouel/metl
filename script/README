This directory contains a script that can be used to generate most
possible metaheuristics given user supplied concepts and the templates
from the framework.

This was created for testing purpose. The list generated can be
compiled, allowing you to check that all algorithms works. Feel free
to play with it. The magic is in the "expand" function. It accepts a
template and does recursive substitution in it. "Symbols" beginning
with * are not looked up for recurcive subtitution themselft.

For example:

set a {*a1 *a2}
set b {*b1 b2}
set b2 {*b21 *b22}

set x [expand a<b>]
puts $x

produces:
*a1<*b1> *a1<*b21> *a1<*b22> *a2<*b1> *a2<*b21> *a2<*b22>
